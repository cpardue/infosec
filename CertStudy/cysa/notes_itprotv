reverse engineering
disassemblers 
ghidra
ida pro if you can hack it
fuzzing types
app ui
protocol 
file format
dumb and smart fuzzers
burp method: enter AAAA in field, locate request in burp, send to intruder, select field, select payload file (sql injection file), attack, view results
nmap
nmap -sn (host scan)
nmap -T4 (faster than default t3)
nmap -n (no dns)
nmap -sS is a default
