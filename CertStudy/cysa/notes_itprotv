DAY THIRTEEN
privacy vs security
not synonyms, there is a distinction between the two
privacy is a subsection of security
data governance for guidance and language
privacy element is outlined through data governance entities
privacy is how we control and oversee PII
governance is the mechanism of control via policy
GDPR
• The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
• The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
• The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
• The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
• The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
if you provide services to clients under an above umbrella, you must align with their policies
non-technical data controls
data governance and lifecycle of data
classification labels and signifies value of different types of created data
classification is attached to data to dictate how securely the data should be treated from a security standpoint
public data vs classified data
interal, official use only, secret, etc
confidentiality as preventing access to assets
confidentiality is applied according to data classification
of course integrity maintains the above
data typing for application of controls
encryption of data at each lifecycle phase
purpose limitation specifies the intended use
data minimization data should only be processed and stored to accomplish purposes A B and C
data sovereignty aligns data to geographies used in
DAY FOURTEEN
data should have a shelf life
retention and retention policies
retention standards 
eDiscovery
storage limitation concerns hipa sox etc
ownership roles as a security control mechanism
roles of ownership
data owner is ultimate authority with how data is protected/used within the org
understand the logic of defining the role, not the individual
senior leaders as typical owner of organizational data
data stewards ensure data quality (labels, formats, compression)
data custodians handle managing and enforcing data backups etc
privacy officer has to do with purpose limitation, PII, PHI, SPI, disclosure, etc, can go to jail from legal standpoint
technical control of legal requirements
regulatory, statue, frameworks and protection levels
determined by geographics and industry, aka data sovereignty
always maintain legal counsel for data soveregnty
non-disclosure agreements as a non-technical control
NDA, SLA, OLA, MOU, ILA, RFP
NDA driven by contractual requirement landscape
there are secrecy acts dealing with gov types of data by the way
SLA stipulate between customer and provider for service coverage, uptime you are buying
ISA interconnection security agreement protects legally the protection of assets
data sharing and usage agreements for hipa and gdpr binding use of data
technical controls
the systems we can put into play to secure environment
mitigate and minimize risk
access controls 
more often than not software driven
ACL access control list
ACE access control entries
can also be physical in nature, such as doors or rfid locks
access control models
apply model of least privilege, just enough to do their specific job
ACL is a listing of all users
ACE is the specific permissions based
geographic access requirements
if not in this location then no access to that
subject requests access to object, what is location of subject and location of object determines access
safe harbor now known as privacy shield
encryption as applied to technical control
system of providing confidentiality and integrity
create integrity via hashing
encryption has to be constantly assessed vs retention policy, cannot be crackable by end of retention (sha1 crackable 7 years later
overlapping complementary controls as defense in depth
data at rest and data in transit should both be encrypted
data at rest, encrypted
data in transit, tls and ssl
encryption of session keys in memory
DAY FIFTEEN
de-identification is basically removing PII, PHI, redacting such information so that elements cannot be identified
data masking is a possible application of de-identification such as asterisks in password fields or CC numbers
data masking should be irreversible in application
tokenization replaces data with a token, while the associated data is stored in a separate tokenization server
token string replaces the data in production database, so hackers in a db see token, as tokenized data is in other db
tokenization is just a sleight of hand where encryption can't be used from hardware or legal standpoint
aggregation/banding replaces unique values with a value range, age 21yrs-30yrs instead of age 25yrs
re-identification attack is reversal of shitty de-identification technique
K value is a value that represents how many individuals, where k-5 means 5 individuals within

calculating and analyzing risk
• Probability is the chance of a threat being realized
• Magnitude is the impact of a successful exploit or a risk event
NOTE: Magnitude may be determined by factors such as the value of the asset or the cost of disruption if the asset is compromised.
Probability * Magnitude = Risk
therefore (decimal percentage * dollar value = risk)
100% probability that Chastain's $500 server dies and costs $1200 t&m = (1*$1700=$1700risk)
quantitative, qualitative, and semi-quantitative:
Quantitative Risk Calculation -
A quantitative assessment of risk attempts to assign concrete values to the elements of risk.
Probability is expressed as a percentage and magnitude as a cost (monetary) value, as in the following formula:
AV (Asset Value) x EF (Exposure Factor) = SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
EF is the percentage of the asset's value that would be lost. 
The single loss expectancy (SLE) value is the financial loss that is expected from a specific adverse event. 
For example, if the asset value is $50,000 and EF is 5%, the SLE calculation is as follows:
$50,000 * .05 = $2,500
If you know or can estimate how many times this loss is likely to occur in a year, you can calculate the risk cost on an annual basis:
SLE (Single Loss Expectancy) x ARO (Annual Rate of Occurrence) = ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy)
Chastain's dead server costs $1700 every 3mo ($1700*4=SLE of $6800)
NOTE: The problem with quantitative risk assessment is that the process of determining and assigning these values can be complex and time consuming.
Qualitative analysis is generally scenario-based.
The qualitative approach seeks out people's opinions of which risk factors are significant.
Qualitative analysis uses simple labels and categories to measure the likelihood and impact of risk.
For example, impact ratings can be severe/high, moderate/medium, or low; and likelihood ratings can be likely, unlikely, or rare.
Semi-Quantitative Risk Calculation -
A semi-quantitative analysis method exists because it is impossible for a purely quantitative risk assessment to exist given that some issues defy numbers.
A semi-quantitative analysis attempts to find a middle ground between the risk analysis types to create a hybrid method.
analyzing risk
BIA business impact analysis assesses potential losses for a threat scenario
MDT maximum tolerable downtime longest that an outage can occure before irrecoverable business failure
RTO recovery time objective is amount of time it takes for service restore
WRT work recovery time is the time it takes to move from service restoration to completed validation testing and debrief
RPO recovery point objective is the amount of data loss a system can sustain, measured in time
